### Issues & Inboxes

Support ticketing in Assembly is made up of “inboxes”, which are team based or private to you. During setup, you must create at least one team (typically a “general team”) which will have access to the “all Issues” inbox. 

If you have more than one team, you may create them here:

Once created, each individual team will be able to see their own inbox, assign tickets to team members, create their own SLA’s & tags, and more.

#### Statuses

Support tickets unattached to an SLA have 3 statuses: needs response, open, and closed.

Needs response refers to a ticket that has either been newly raised by a customer or an existing “open” ticket that has been updated by the customer. 

Open tickets are those that are waiting for the customer to respond or take action. Typically this could be after your first response or after you have resolved the issue and are waiting for confirmation from the customer. 

Once issues are resolved or are stale, you can move the ticket into the “closed” state. Note, that if a customer responds to an issue previously closed, it will return to the “needs response” state.

#### Service Level Agreements (SLA)

SLA are the Service Level Agreements that you have with your customers. To set one up, go to the preferences page from the dashboard and navigate to the SLA section 

<br/>

<br/>


There you’ll be able to determine an SLA with a breach limit (how long you have to respond) and a warning notification (when you’ll receive a bump in slack or another messenger to respond prior to breaching) 

If you are unable to respond within the SLA period, the ticket will move under the “breaching” status. Once responded to, the ticket’s SLA timer will reset for the next customer message.

#### Alerting

To set up slack notifications for new support requests, issues that have been updated by customers, and to avoid breaching SLA’s, navigate to the Alerts page underneath preferences

<br/>

<br/>

You can customize what kinds of requests you would like to receive notifications for. To select which slack channel to funnel these notifications, hit the enable notifications toggle at the bottom of the page and choose a channel. 

We recommend that you create your own “assembly-notifications” channel to keep support requests separate from other notifications in slack. 

#### Business Hours
To set business hours for yourself or for your team, navigate to your profile or the members tab under team

Hit the “Add Hours” and customize when you would like to receive notifications, have SLA’s turned on, and more.
