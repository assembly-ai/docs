#### API Key

You must first create an API Key in Assembly. It is located under "Manage Integrations", then scroll to the bottom and click "Manage API Keys".

Here, you can see your existing keys, their names and expiration. You can delete existing ones. 

When creating a new API key, the name must be unique in your organization. Once the key has been created, you will be shown a one-time dialog box with your new API key. You should copy this down somewhere safe -- we will not show this again. 

If you lose your API key, you will need to make a new one.

#### Sending Events

Here is the API endpoint for sending events to Assembly. The only required field is <b>query</b>:

```bash
curl -X \
 POST https://chat-widget-7vb6.onrender.com/interactions \
 -F "query=Sample query text" \
 -H "Authorization: <API_KEY>" \
 -H "Content-Type: multipart/form-data" 
```

If you want to specify who is sending/creating the ticket, include a user. The user must have an email field. All the other fields (`id`, `name`, `username`, `image_url`) are optional.
You can also pass in other optional fields like the title, original timestamp, and additional attributes.

```bash
curl -X \
 POST https://chat-widget-7vb6.onrender.com/interactions \
 -F "title=Sample title" \
 -F "query=Sample query text" \
 -F "user={\"id\": \"userID\", \"email\": \"userEmail@gmail.com\"}" \
 -F "additional_properties={\"key1\": \"value1\", \"key2\": 123, \"key3\": \"value3\"}" \
 -F "original_timestamp=2024-06-10T18:34:00Z" \
 -H "Authorization: <API_KEY>" \
 -H "Content-Type: multipart/form-data"
```


You can also pass in a base64 encoded image if you prefer, or an image URL:

```bash
curl -X POST https://chat-widget-7vb6.onrender.com/interactions \
-F "query=Sample query text" \
-F "files_base64=<base64 encoded image>" \
-H "Authorization: 3fb05781f6504431e7e38c4ba0617097d59aa09e611893f9dfbc306158bffa4e8a3e86f239a3cba19ebe4c5a4bae10d2" \
-H "Content-Type: multipart/form-data"
```

```bash
curl -X POST https://chat-widget-7vb6.onrender.com/interactions \
-F "query=Sample query text" \
-F "files_image_url=https://example.com/img.jpg" \
-H "Authorization: 3fb05781f6504431e7e38c4ba0617097d59aa09e611893f9dfbc306158bffa4e8a3e86f239a3cba19ebe4c5a4bae10d2" \
-H "Content-Type: multipart/form-data"
```

You can attach multiple images by passing in multiple files.

```bash
curl -X POST https://chat-widget-7vb6.onrender.com/interactions \
-F "query=Sample query text" \
-F "files_base64=<base64 encoded image_1>" \
-F "files_base64=<base64 encoded image_2>" \
-H "Authorization: 3fb05781f6504431e7e38c4ba0617097d59aa09e611893f9dfbc306158bffa4e8a3e86f239a3cba19ebe4c5a4bae10d2" \
-H "Content-Type: multipart/form-data"
```


The files field is used to send images to Assembly. You can currently send JPG and PNG images up to 4MB in size.
