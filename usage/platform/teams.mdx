description: 'Support ticketing in Assembly is made up of “inboxes”, which are team based or private to you. During setup, you must create at least one team (typically a “general team”) which will have access to the “all Issues” inbox.

### Team Setup

If you have more than one team, you may create them here : Dashboard > Preferences > on the left hand sidebar: 

<br/>
<img
  style={{ borderRadius: '0.5rem' }}
  src="images/Teams_Create.png"
/>
<br/>

Once a team has been created - you’ll need to assign accounts the team has access to under its settings page. All new incoming tickets will be synced to each team accordingly. 

<br/>
<img
  style={{ borderRadius: '0.5rem' }}
  src="images/Teams_Settings.png"
/>
<br/>

Once created, each individual team will be able to see their own inbox, assign tickets to team members, create their own SLA’s & tags, and more. 


#### General Team
The General team on the left hand sidebar represents the home of Assembly. All issues can be viewed here, setup, overarching analytics and companies. Each team serves as a subset of issues of the General team. 

Each remaining team contains the interactions for the accounts assigned to the team. This will also start to contain team-based Analytics and Product Insights.
