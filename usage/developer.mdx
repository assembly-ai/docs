### Developer

You can send events from your own integrations to Assembly. 

#### API Key

You must first create an API Key in Assembly. It is located under "Manage Integrations", then scroll to the bottom and click "Manage API Keys".

Here, you can see your existing keys, their names and expiration. You can delete existing ones. 

When creating a new API key, the name must be unique in your organization. Once the key has been created, you will be shown a one-time dialog box with your new API key. You should copy this down somewhere safe -- we will not show this again. 

If you lose your API key, you will need to make a new one.

#### Sending Events

Here is the API endpoint for sending events to Assembly:

```bash
curl -X \
 POST https://chat-widget-7vb6.onrender.com/interaction \
 -F "title=Sample title" \
 -F "query=Sample query text" \
 -F "user_name=John Doe" \
 -F "user_email=john@example.com" \
 -F "user_image_url=https://example.com/profile.jpg" \
 -F "files=@img.jpg" \
 -H "Authorization: 3fb05781f6504431e7e38c4ba0617097d59aa09e611893f9dfbc306158bffa4e8a3e86f239a3cba19ebe4c5a4bae10d2" \
 -H "Content-Type: multipart/form-data"
```

All the fields except `query` are optional. 

The files field is used to send images to Assembly. You can currently send JPG and PNG images up to 4MB in size.

Here are some of the errors that may be returned:

- 400: Invalid request - missing title, file too large
- 401: Invalid API Key or expired API Key
- 502: Couldn't open the image file
- 503: Assembly server error has been logged and our team has been notified

Errors take on the following format in JSON:

```json
{"error": "message"}
```

Successful responses take on the following format in JSON:

```json
{"created_ticket_number": "AAA-111"}
```
