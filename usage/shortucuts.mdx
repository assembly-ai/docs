We’ve purpose built Assembly to seamlessly blend into your workflow. After responding to a ticket in the Queue, hold “command” (on Mac), or cntrl (on windows), and tap the “right” arrow button to move onto the next ticket in your queue. 
To go back to previous tickets, hit the command + left arrow (or control)
