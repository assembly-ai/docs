#### Overview

Needs response refers to a ticket that has either been newly raised by a customer or an existing “open” ticket that has been updated by the customer. 

Open tickets are those that are waiting for the customer to respond or take action. Typically this could be after your first response or after you have resolved the issue and are waiting for confirmation from the customer. 

Once issues are resolved or are stale, you can move the ticket into the “closed” state. Note, that if a customer responds to an issue previously closed, it will return to the “needs response” state.
