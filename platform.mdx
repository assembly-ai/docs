### Teams

Support ticketing in Assembly is made up of “inboxes”, which are team based or private to you. During setup, you must create at least one team (typically a “general team”) which will have access to the “all Issues” inbox. 

#### Team Setup

If you have more than one team, you may create them here : Dashboard > Preferences > on the left hand sidebar: 

<br/>

<br/>

Once a team has been created - you’ll need to assign accounts the team has access to under its settings page. All new incoming tickets will be synced to each team accordingly.

<br/>

Once created, each individual team will be able to see their own inbox, assign tickets to team members, create their own SLA’s & tags, and more. 


#### General Team
The General team on the left hand sidebar represents the home of Assembly. All issues can be viewed here, setup, overarching analytics and companies. Each team serves as a subset of issues of the General team. 

Each remaining team contains the interactions for the accounts assigned to the team. This will also start to contain team-based Analytics and Product Insights. 


### Labels

Right of the top, Assembly has two types of labels: “request type” and “request topic”. 

<br/>

<br/>

<b>Request type</b> refers to whether the support request is a bug, feature request, or a general question. This label are automatically attached to every incoming support request. You can change label here:

<b>Request Topic</b> is what about the product this support request is about. Examples of these tags are “billing”, “account management”, “authentication”, and more. You can turn on AI auto-tagging for these topic labels by clicking on the AI-Autotagging toggle!

<br/>

Describe the title and then select a “trigger”. This refers to what will start the workflow and can be things like a new support request tagged as a bug. Now you will setup the rules for this workflow.

Select the appropriate condition (if statement) for the workflow and then select an action. Once the ruleset for the workflow is saved, you can view them on the main workflow table! 


### Customer Groups
Organize your customer into different buckets or segments. To create a group, click the “create customer group button”

<br/>

<br/>

Then, create a group by any filter you would like. This could be by source (customer in slack versus teams or email), ACV (stored in Stripe or CRM), or more.

### Knowledge Search
Assembly offers platform level search across not just support requests, but also your entire knowledge base (regardless of where it is). You may search through slack messages, your ticketing system (linear/jira), help center (intercom/zendesk), notion, confluence, even PR’s if you’d like. 

Navigate to the manage integrations page and choose which parts of your knowledge base you would like to add to our search algorithm.
